# Chihayaburu

A Discord bot that automates HoYoLab check-ins.

## Usage and inviting

We recommend using the bot hosted by us. You can invite it [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=855549305083396107&permissions=2048&scope=bot).
However, if you want to host it yourself, you can do so by adding a `config.json` like below and running the Docker container (Docker and Docker Compose required):

```json
{
	"token": YOUR_TOKEN,
	"clientId": YOUR_CLIENT_ID
}
```
